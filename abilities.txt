leadership: Number of crew this officer can competently command.  Cap is
  determined by table AB.1. An officer can command crew as if they had a
  higher leadership score by trading 1 crew level for 1 level of Leadership.
  there is no limit to how low a crew's level may be pushed this way, so a
  highly incompetant officer may cause his crew to be a greater danger to the
  vessel than even enemy action!
  e.g. An officer with a leadership of 5 (400 cap) may command up to 800 crew,
   but the crew will operate as if they were 1 level lower than they are
