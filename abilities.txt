leadership: Amount of crew this officer can competently command.  Cap is
  determined by table AB.1. An officer can command crew as if they had a
  higher leadership score by trading 1 crew level for 1 level of Leadership.
  there is no limit to how low a crew's level may be pushed this way, so a
  highly incompetant officer may cause his crew to be a greater danger to the
  vessel than even enemy action!
  e.g. An officer with a leadership of 5 (400 cap) may command up to 800 crew,
   but the crew will operate as if they were 1 level lower than they are

  AB.1 Crew caps by leadership
  | Leadership | Name              | Crew cap  | Autonomy |
  |------------|-------------------|-----------|----------|
  | 0          | incompetent       | 0         |
  | 1          | squad leader      | 25        |
  | 2          | sergeant          | 50        |
  | 3          |                   | 100       |
  | 4          |                   | 200       |
  | 5          |                   | 400       |
  | 6          | taskmaster        | 800       |
  | 7          | motivator         | 1600      |
  | 8          | commander         | 3200      |
  | 9          | high commander    | 6400      |
  | 10         | supreme commander | unlimited |

  Leadership is also used to determine who the commodore of a fleet is. It is
  simply the officer in the fleet with the highest leadership, and they can be
  assigned to any slot. Their ship is also automatically the flagship.  Right
  now, these roles are purely aesthetic, but they might be more meaningful in
  the future.
  Lastly, Leadership determines what level of autonomy a vessel may have.
Diplomacy: How skilled this officer is at negotiating, intimidation, and
  otherwise dealing with others.  This also affects how the crew of a ship
  views their officers. High-diplomacy officers are generally liked by their
  crew, so they tend to be braver, more competent, and happier. this translates
  into bonuses to combat morale, experience point gain, and non-combat morale.
  Diplomacy also affects trading - higher scores get better prices
  TODO: figure out how diplomacy will work
logistics: handles the management of resources. Low levels do badly at keeping
  track of resources and needs, and cause a lot of inefficiencies (wasted
  resources).  middle levels tend to have accurate inventories, and smaller
  inefficiencies. high levels have entirely accurate inventories, mitigate
  sudden spikes in supply/demand, and introduce some efficiency optimizations.
  storage of resources under an officer with high logistics also tend to have
  higher capacities.  Dangerous resources are also more stable with higher
  logistics. finally, logistics factors into trading (high score gives higher
  buyer confidence, so lower prices) and management of freighter fleets
astrogation: Handles plotting courses to move the fleet around the galaxy.
  Higher levels plot courses that use less fuel, and arrive sooner. Middle and
  high levels are capable of plotting faster courses that use more fuel, or
  slower ones that use less fuel.  In combat, this effects maneuver efficiency.
piloting: Handles the maneuvering of vessels out of combat.  High levels
  execute maneuvers with less fuel, and can enter more orbital slots.  High
  levels are also better at intercepting targets, be it another fleet, an
  anomaly, or some other celestial body.  Low levels risk damaging or even
  destroying their vessel when doing some maneuvers.
maneuvering: Handles the actual execution of maneuvers in combat. Higher levels
  unlock better maneuvers, and perform existing ones better.  High levels
  provide passive dodge bonuses. Low levels inflict weapon accuracy penalties,
  as well as dodge penalties.  High levels also allow for hard-boarding on non
  immobile targets.
heavy weapons: Handles the usage of a vessel's primary weapons. These can be
  spine or turret mounted.  Higher levels gain accuracy, reloading and damage
  bonuses. some low levels inflict penalties, however. High levels also unlock
  special firing patterns.  High levels also provide maintenance bonuses
point defense: Handles the usage of a vessels small defensive weapons.
  These are always turrent mounted, and are usually mounted as arrays. Higher
  levels provide bonuses to successfully defend against an attack.  High levels
  also unlock special firing patterns. High levels may also provide maintenance
  bonuses.
ordnance: Handles the usage of a vessel's weapons that employ a more complex
  and usually slower projectile than Heavy weapons. (missiles, torpedoes,
  mines).  Higher levels provide accuracy bonuses and defensive bonuses to the
  weapons themselves, but _not_ damage. High levels also unlock special
  targetting programs and firing patterns.  High levels also provide bonuses to
  manufacturing reloads, and unlock advanced modifications to the weapons.
spacecraft: Handles the management and operation of small autonomous craft that
  operate out of a vessel (fighters, shuttles, etc).  Higher levels provide,
  piloting, accuracy, and maintenance bonuses. The level of this ability also
  directly affects how many spacecraft a vessel may employ at once, just like
  Leadership for crew.  High levels unlock special maneuvers for these
  spacecraft.
deckfighting: Handles the hand-to-hand fighting of marines during a boarding
  action. Higher levels provide h2h combat bonuses. High levels also unlock
  special boarding tactics.
training: Handles the training of crew.  Higher levels provide bonuses to crew
  experience gain, and provide a slow supply of experience out of combat.
repair:  Handles the repair of damage to a vessel and it's systems.  Higher
  levels can repair more damaged systems, and can do it faster, with less
  resources.  High levels also unlock preventative
