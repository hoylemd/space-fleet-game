leadership: Amount of crew this officer can competently command.  Cap is
  determined by table AB.1. An officer can command crew as if they had a
  higher leadership score by trading 1 crew level for 1 level of Leadership.
  there is no limit to how low a crew's level may be pushed this way, so a
  highly incompetant officer may cause his crew to be a greater danger to the
  vessel than even enemy action!
  e.g. An officer with a leadership of 5 (400 cap) may command up to 800 crew,
   but the crew will operate as if they were 1 level lower than they are

  Leadership is also used to determine who the commodore of a fleet is. It is
  simply the officer in the fleet with the highest leadership, and they can be
  assigned to any slot. Their ship is also automatically the flagship.  Right
  now, these roles are purely aesthetic, but they might be more meaningful in
  the future.
  Lastly, Leadership determines what level of autonomy a vessel may have.
