game area: map. virtual area determined by fleet sizes. no actual limits, the
  map only exists for initial placement and coordinate systems
only allow view scrolling away from active vessels as far as half of the
  initial map area
origin for combat area coordinates is the center of the initial map area
each side has a fleet, and is assigned a map edge randomly
place each vessel per fleet on the map edge they are assigned
combat is turn-based, with vessels acting in initiative order
initiative is determined by vessels' commander's initiative score, or 1 / 4 of
  their level
in the case of initiative ties, order of action within group of vessels tied
  for initiative is determined randomly each turn.
vessels may fire, move, hack, and board each turn.
movement distance is determined by propulsion systems and engineer abilities
