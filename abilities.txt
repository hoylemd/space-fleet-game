leader: every point = x2 crew commandable (with 20 at 1). If an officer has
  more than their limit of crew under them, the crew operates as 1 level lower.
  This penalty doubles for every multiple of their crew limit they are
  exceeding it by.
  e.g. if an officer has Leader 1, and commands 39 crew at level 3, the crew
    operates at level 2
  e.g. officer has Leader 2, and commands 160 crew at level 5 (40 capacity +
    120 over, which is 3 * their capacity), the crew operates at level 1
    ( 5 - (2 ^ (3 - 1)) = 4)
  comm systems can add a multiplier to this. Crews with a negative level suffer
  large penalties, and lose loyalty equal to their level every stardate.
